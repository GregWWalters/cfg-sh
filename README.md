==

A repository of configuration files for UNIX shells. All files are POSIX
compliant and ready to use with `sh`, or can be sourced from configuration
files for other shells such as `bash` and `zsh`.

The file "profile" is meant to be symlinked from "\$HOME/.profile".

Not found in this repository is a file ".secrets". This untracked file can be
added to store sensitive values such as API keys.
